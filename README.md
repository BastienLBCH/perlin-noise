# Perlin noise in pure rust
This is a little project I made on my free time to understand the Perlin Noise algorithm

# Build and run
You need to have cargo installed

 - Download or clone this repository
   - ```git clone git@github.com:BastienLBCH/perlin-noise.git```
 - Go inside this directory
   - ```cd perlin-noise```
 - Run the project:
   - ```cargo run```
 
 You can also build a binary with this command.
   - ```cargo build --release```

Building the binary with the --release flag will increase the compilation time 
but improve the program performances
